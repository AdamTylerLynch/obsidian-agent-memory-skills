# Projects

Each project gets its own subtree with scoped architecture, components, and patterns.

## Active

| Project | Domain | Type |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

## Adding a New Project

1. Create `projects/{name}/` with `{name}.md` as the project overview
2. Add subfolders as needed: `architecture/`, `components/`, `patterns/`
3. Link from this index
4. Tag all notes with `#project/{short-name}`
